# Roblox Boilerplate

Consider this a project template of sorts? It's a bit scrappy and pulled together from pieces of the "engine" that I currently use to make games on Roblox.
I'm releasing this as a reference to hopefully help future Roblox developers see there's a much better way to have a game's architecture setup. It's inspired by Knit, but its also fully type-checked and compliant with Luau's `--!strict` typechecker.

Here be dragons. Best of luck if you sample from any material here.
Please do provide credit for anything I wrote here if you do though ;)
